# Perch Hoplite

Hoplite is a system for storing large volumes of embeddings from machine
perception models. We focus on combining vector search with active learning
workflows, aka [agile modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12948).

While we get this documentation ready, we recommend checking out the main
[Perch repository](https://github.com/google-research/perch).
